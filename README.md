Showcase 1: Transcription Factor Binding Site Analysis in Maize Promoters (Python)

Description:
This project identifies transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) in the promoter regions of co-expressed maize genes. The analysis compares motif counts in selected genes against randomly chosen genes to detect over- or under-represented motifs. It demonstrates Python-based genomic data processing, including extracting upstream non-coding sequences and motif search using pattern-matching algorithms.

Showcase 2: Sequence Clustering of Chiroptera Genes

Description:
This project investigates the clustering patterns of two genes, COI (Cytochrome c Oxidase Subunit I) and cytb (Cytochrome b), in bats (Chiroptera). It applies unsupervised machine learning techniques to identify sequence similarities and differences within this taxonomic group. The analysis highlights genomic diversity and showcases R-based data visualization and clustering methods.
